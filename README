This patch and Makefile will yield a static library build of Python2.7.3 (32bit)
for Windows, making it easy to embed python into your application.

Prerequisites:

* Python-2.7.3.tgz
* openssl-1.0.1c.tar.gz

* nasm 2.09.10 installed, copy nasm.exe to nasmw.exe
* ActivePerl 32-bit binary distribution
* 7zip installed
* Windows SDK 7.1
* GNU patch as patch.exe in PATH

Run the build:

call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.Cmd" /RELEASE /x86 /xp
SET PATH=C:\Program Files\7-Zip;C:\Program Files (x86)\nasm;%PATH%
nmake

This will build OpenSSL and then pythonembed.lib in Python-2.7.3\PCbuild. If its about 17MB in size, it's right. 


Note that the final pythonembed.lib will have dynamic loading of external C extensions
disabled.
